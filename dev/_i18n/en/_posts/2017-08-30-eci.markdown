<!-- - opening story -->

What would happen if a doctor could know beforehand if a child is going to have health issues?

Let's say a mother with her baby arrives at the doctor's office to have a routine check-up. The doctor does his job and everything
seems fine. He enters all the new info of the baby on the computer but the computer says that the baby is probably going to be at
risk... in four months.

Today, this is still science fiction, but we are not THAT far from it. Today I'll write about a competition I took part of, which addressed a
similar problem: given some measurements like the weight or height of a baby, will those values be dangerously low in the future?

# The problem to solve

In the context of the ECI week (School of Informatics Sciences for its initials in Spanish), a competition was launched in [Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/eci2017-1) which theme was children health analysis.
The problem consisted in a dataset of routine check-ups for different babies in different regions of Argentina, and we had
to predict if the z-scores for height, weight and body mass (HAZ, WAZ, BMIZ from now on) will be below a given threshold in the
next check-up.

The competition was open to everyone, it is an interesting problem and a good classifier will have a positive impact in national medicine.

Also, it has been a long time since I didn't compete, so it was the perfect excuse. <i class="material-icons">sentiment_very_satisfied</i>

# Let's look at the data

The dataset for this competition is pretty straightforward and small enough for running nice experiments.
The train set has **43933** rows and the test set **6275** rows. Both sets have 23 columns (features).

Here are the first rows of the original train data:


<button ng-click="showFilters=!showFilters" class="btn btn-default" ng-show="!showFilters" style="display:table;">Show Filters</button>
<button ng-click="showFilters=!showFilters" class="btn btn-default active" ng-show="showFilters" style="display:table;">Hide Filters</button>


<div class="material-switch row filtros" ng-show="showFilters">
<ul class="list-group ">
    <li class="list-group-item col-xs-3" ng-repeat="col in columns">
        [[{col.field}]]
        <div class="material-switch pull-left">
            <input ng-model="col.show" id="[[{col.field}]]" name="[[{col.field}]]" type="checkbox"/>
            <label for="[[{col.field}]]" class="label-primary"></label>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="ng-table-scrollcontainer">
<table ng-table-dynamic="tableParams with columns" show-filter="false" class="table table-bordered table-striped waka">

  <tr ng-repeat="user in $data" ng-class="{azul: esFalse(user), azuloscuro: !esFalse(user)}">
    <td data-title="col.field" header-title="'col.field'" ng-repeat="col in $columns">[[{user[col.field]}]]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Here we have the description of each feature:

<!-- - ver lo que hay que predecir, decae -->
<br>
Now let's see what we have to predict. Our target variable is made of three conditions:

<div class="tabla" >
<table >
<tr style="background-color:#C5CAE9 !important">
<td>Decae (Target variable) </td>
<td>
It takes the value "True" if at least one of the following conditions occurs:
<div style="margin: auto;  display: table;">
<div style="vertical-align: middle;font-size: 70px;margin-top: 22px;">
{
</div>
<div class="" style="font-family: monospace;display: table-cell;vertical-align: middle;">
<div class="">
<span>HAZ &gt;= -1 and next_HAZ &lt; -1</span>
</div>
<div class="">
<span>WAZ &gt;= -1 and next_WAZ &lt; -1</span>
</div>
<div class="">
<span>BMIZ &gt;= -1 and next_BMIZ &lt; -1</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

This is, if the current value for the z-score is greater than -1 and in the next check-up it is less than -1 we can say
that the value dropped below an acceptable range, and the baby is possibly at risk (and our target variable is true).
Note that if the previous value was below -1, the next value doesn't matter because our condition will always be false.


<br>
A couple of examples:

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="tabla mark-last-row" >
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>HAZ check-up  Jun '16</td>
<td>HAZ check-up  Nov '16</td>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign tooltipo">
    <span class="tooltipotext"> True, HAZ was &gt;= -1 and now is &lt; -1</span>
</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign tooltipo">

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign tooltipo">
    <span class="tooltipotext"> Both checkups are below -1, the condition needs the first one to be &gt;= -1</span>
</span>
</td>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p class="table-note">HAZ over two different check-ups</p>

    <tr>

        <th>BMIZ Jun '16</th>
        <th>HAZ Nov '16</th>
        <th>BMIZ Nov '16</th>
        <th>decae</th>

    </tr>

</span>

</td>

</tbody>

</div>

<p class="table-note">HAZ and BMIZ over two different check-ups</p>
<br>



The row highlighted is false regardless of being below -1.0 because HAZ also was below -1.0 on the previous check-up . Here we have a dependency, the target variable depends
on the value of the previous seen check-up , and it has to be >= -1 for the target to be true. This is a hard threshold/limit and we will explore later what happens
on some of the models we train if we just ignore it.


One last thing to mention is that the scoring metric that we will use is **ROC AUC** [(interactive)](http://www.navan.name/roc/){:target="_blank"}

# First things first

Let's say Alice and Bob download the train set and start working. Alice idea is to have a good model, clean, with nice features
and good hyperparameters before submitting a solution. Bob on the other hand thinks it's better to be able to submit quickly
and then improve the solution.

Alice works for a week before submitting, guiding her work on the results of her own validation set. But the day she submits
her solution, something went wrong and the score is lower than she expected. It could be a bug on her code, or she overfitted at
some point and now she has to go back to a possibly complex program to debug.

Bob does just the minimal work to have a solution as fast as possible. He did a basic clean up of the dataset, ran any model with
default parameters and generated the solution. He submitted and got a not-so-good score, but now he has a baseline on which
to improve. He knows his pipeline works from end to end, he just has to improve the solution.

I'm not saying that anyone that does what Alice did will make a mistake before having a solution, but I think it's better to have
a working solution and then improve on it. This is true in competitions and also in the industry.

<!-- - puntaje del primer submit, posicion en medio de la tabla -->
So I did exactly that, I cleaned up the dataset (basic imputation and labeling), ran a Gradient Boosting model with default
parameters and submitted. My baseline score was *0.77043* and it was enough to be on the top ten at that time!

# Exploring the data
<!-- - exploracion, regiones y mapitas -->
Before going any further it's a good idea to actually see the data and think how it can help us solve the problem.
If we were a doctor, how can we intuitively know if there's something wrong with a baby? Probably measuring his weight, height,
and other things could help. We can see his socioeconomic environment, does he live in a zone with higher probability of
leading to health problems? Ideally, we could also see his mother's situation, is she healthy? Does she take good care of her baby?

We don't have that last bit of information, but we have something about the first two parts. We have the weights, heights and z-scores and some geographic data that we can extrapolate with external socioeconomic data.

Let's start with the z-scores. Here you can see some examples, and how they relate to the target variable:
{% include image-group.html images=site.data.eci1 lang='en' %}

We see that, between certain points, we have more density of cases with the target variable on true. This could be useful later if we can encode this information into our model.

We have an insight on the data now. Remember that we have **43933** rows in the training set. We have **22010** males, this is half of the data and the other half are females, so it's
balanced. We also have **17467** cases from Tucumán (a lot) and this will possibly influence the results that depend on locations. The feature "Zona_rural"
has **42970** rows on False, this is most of the dataset. This feature has almost no variance and is a possible candidate to be removed.
Another interesting point to see is that there're very extreme values as min and max for our z-score variables. Having a HAZ of -5 must
mean a very extreme case.

Finally, our target variable "decae" has *37031* rows on False. This is almost 80% of the dataset so we have a problem with unbalanced classes and this will affect the performance of our estimators.


We also have the coordinates of the different hospitals. It is reasonable to think that there are zones with higher risk than others.
I plotted all the hospitals on the map and we can see that it can be a good idea to define new sub-regions on some provinces. For example,
we can divide Buenos Aires in South/Center-North/Greater Buenos Aires.

I applied some jitter and alpha blending to the points in the data to be able to see the zones with more or less density of pacients.

Here we have grouped the hospitals only geographically, but we can try one more thing. We can group the hospitals by the ratio of healthy/unhealthy kids using the
target variable. For each hospital we count the number of patients that have the target variable in true versus the ones that are false, we divide those numbers and we have a ratio.
If the hospital #123 has 80 patients with the target on False and 20 with the target on True, our new feature is r = 0.8.
We will see in the next post that this approach was better than the geographic one.

One last and very important thing, we can see that the train data is made of one check-up per row and several patients are repeated. In fact, most of the patients have three or four rows in the train set.
Not only that, those patients who have three rows correspond to the same patients that are on the test set. We have the history of the patients in the test set!


In the next post, I'll continue with these ideas and explain the new features I generated and the predictive models I used to play in the competition.
